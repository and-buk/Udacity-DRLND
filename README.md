# Udacity-DRLND

This repository contains my completed project solutions for [**Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree program**](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-reinforcement-learning-nanodegree--nd893).

- **[p_lab-taxi](https://github.com/and-buk/Udacity-DRLND/tree/master/p_lab-taxi)**: Implementation of **Temporal-Difference (TD) control methods** to solve [**OpenAI Gym's Taxi-v3**](https://gym.openai.com/envs/Taxi-v3/) environment.

- **[p_navigation](https://github.com/and-buk/Udacity-DRLND/tree/master/p_navigation)**: Implementation of **Double DQN algorithm with dueling network architecture** to solve the specially prepared environment for project (*similar to, but not identical to the Banana Collector environment on the [Unity ML-Agents GitHub page](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Learning-Environment-Examples.md#banana-collector)*). 

- **[p_continuous_control](https://github.com/and-buk/Udacity-DRLND/tree/master/p_continuous_control)**: Implementation of *amended* **Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (DDPG) algorithm** *specifically adapted to work for multiple agents* to solve the [**Reacher**](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Learning-Environment-Examples.md#reacher) environment with continuous action space.

- **[p_collaboration_and_competition](https://github.com/and-buk/Udacity-DRLND/tree/master/p_collaboration_and_competition)**: Implementation of **Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (MADDPG) algorithm** to solve the specially prepared environment which require multiple agents to work together (*similar to, but not identical to the Tennis environment on the [Unity ML-Agents GitHub page](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Learning-Environment-Examples.md)*).
